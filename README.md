<p align="center">
Ransomware is malware that employs encryption to hold a victim’s information at ransom. A user or organization’s critical data is encrypted so that they cannot access files, databases, or applications. A ransom is then demanded to provide access.

### In this Project
In this Project you will see how we create a ransomware program using python to find target text files and delete them after encryption. We will also demostrate fake ransom payment and recovery of files via decryption.

The following will be covered in this program:
- Attack a vulnerable computer by Create a ransomware  program
- To scan and select appropriate target files according to their type.
- Generate cryptographically secure random numbers 
- Generate  RSA based asymmetric key pairs, and AES_CBC
- Develop an  encryption scheme based on the  RSA based asymmetric key pairs, and AES_CBC based symmetric keys, for each targeted files.
- Develop recovery program for the recovery of the different types of encryption keys, as well as the encrypted files.

Project is Done by Saniya and partner; Madeeha. UOWD 2021
